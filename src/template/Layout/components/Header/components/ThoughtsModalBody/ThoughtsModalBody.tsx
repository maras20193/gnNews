    <S.Title>The coolest:</S.Title>
    <p>
      I think, the coolest thing for me was at the beginning, when I planned the
      whole application, I drew screens on a piece of paper, wrote down what
      components I would need, and when I started coding &#128512;

    <S.Title>The hardest:</S.Title>
    <p>
      The hardest for me for sure was testing. I do not have a lot of experience
      with advanced tests. I usually wrote simple unit tests. But thanks to this
      I came across a few things and learned something new &#x1f4aa;
